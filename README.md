OmniTracker-Pro Let's you track any item/action/habit with a very simple interface.

Allows you to monitor any progress in statistics.

It's a web-app, and can run on any browser, or can be installed on Android or Apple mobile devices.

Priorities and notes:
1) Local first, very limited and non-repeating internet server connections. (Only when run for the first time)
2) Checks for version updates only weekly.
3) No data is stored on any servers. All data is saved on local devices. They are not encrypted, so make sure your device is protected!
4) The user-data can be backed up using the export feature. It's up to the user to protect the exported data.
5) It doesn't sync across devices. Because it runs totally local. Device changes must be manually handled by the user (e.g. all stats must be exported, and imported (if and when that feature is available))
6) Developed (prompted) and briefly tested by a human, using chat-bot AI (Gemini).
